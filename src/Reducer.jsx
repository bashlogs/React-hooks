import React from 'react';


// Some information


// The current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.
// The dispatch function that lets you change it in response to interaction.

// To update whatâ€™s on the screen, call dispatch with an object representing what the user did, called an action:

// function handleClick() {
//      dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
// }

// React will pass the current state and the action to your reducer function. Your reducer will calculate and return the next state. 
// React will store that next state, render your component with it, and update the UI.

// If there is more than one action you want to use the useReducer is best option since you don't have to write multiple state.

        default:
            return state
